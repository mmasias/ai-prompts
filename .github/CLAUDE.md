# AI-Prompts Repository Guidelines

## Structure
- Repository focuses on AI/LLM prompts, use cases, and documentation
- Content organized in directories following established hierarchy
- Markdown (.md) is the primary file format

## File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive lowercase filenames with camelCase when needed
- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or camelCase)
- Create README.md in each directory for navigation

## Markdown Style
- Use headers hierarchically (# for titles, ## for sections)
- Include navigation elements at top of documents
- Reference other documents using relative links
- Use tables for structured comparison information
- Include image references with width specifications when appropriate

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive
- Prefix commits with context (e.g., "New:", "Fix:", "Update:")
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes

## Commands
- No specific build/lint/test commands identified
- Repository is primarily documentation in Markdown format
- Use standard git commands for file management

## For Claude/AI Agents
- Focus on maintaining consistent document structure
- Follow existing navigation patterns when creating/editing files
- Respect established file organization conventions
